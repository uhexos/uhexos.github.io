If you're reading this I have _mastered_ **HUGO**. If you're reading this I yes have _mastered_ **HUGO**. Do you hear the people sing singing the song of angry men this is the music of a people  who will not be slaves again when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes will you give all you can give so that our banner may be flown. beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see, then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free,
